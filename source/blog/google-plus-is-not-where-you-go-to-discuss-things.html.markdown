# How not to win friends at Safari or how Google+ is not where you go to discuss things


It is important for any product feedback platform you build to let people give their feedback how THEY want to do so.

Twitter, if is super secret let them DM an account

Facebook > private account

Google+ > private account

etc. etc.
