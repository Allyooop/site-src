# First impression of safari for android

* nice to have unlimited downloads


### User flows

##### Want to read a book

little bit jarring the load and then jump to content

travelling through pages, chapters. Links.


##### Find a new book

##### Find a chapter on something I need to know, trying to solve


### Lack of syntax highlighting

### unlimited downloading
