The beta test of the new Safari app got off to a bit of a rough start. It was impossible to download outside the US for quite a while, which was pretty annoying for a something you pay for. But a hickup is a hickup. Took a bit of a hack around but I got the app to download.

The app has a dedicated Google+ group 

# First impression of safari for android

* nice to have unlimited downloads


### User flows

##### Want to read a book

little bit jarring the load and then jump to content

travelling through pages, chapters. Links.


##### Find a new book

##### Find a chapter on something I need to know, trying to solve


### Lack of syntax highlighting

### unlimited downloading

#### Features

Would be nice to have a schedule download, so if I am on the road I can say "when I'm in wifi get this book"

Notifications of new books in my areas of interest

ability to watch videos
