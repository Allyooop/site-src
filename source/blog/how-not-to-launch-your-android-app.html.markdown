# How not to launch your beta android app

A little while back on Twitter I teased the Safari books team about the lack of an Android app. They had one in the pipeline but nothing had come of it.

Apparently I wasn't alone in that feeling and there was a whole Google+ group created to appease/lock away all of us annoyed Androiders.

I like Safari. Yeah, thre are a few things that would improve the experience but the lack of an Android app is a major miss.

> #### WHY OH GOD WHY DO THEY NOT HAVE SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING?
> Seriously tech book people, get some bloody syntax highlighting in your books! Mmmmm greyscale code. And Safari, why don't you just force it into their books? Seriously?

After some design previews, today ```23-01-2015``` Safari actually gone and dropped the app.

Hurrah sang the chorus.

Well, that is until they tried downloading the app.

That is a mega fail. I'm in the UK and the Google+ group all seemed to suffer a similar fate.

I did what any hero does in that situation and sardonically moaned on Twitter

They understood they failed it up. And said they were just waiting for Google Play to update. That was several hours ago and it still hasn't for me.

I'm looking forwarding to using it. But, that isn't how you launch your beta android app.

If you have an international audience, double check you haven't added (or not removed!) any uneeded restrictions
