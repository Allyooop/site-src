# How not to tell Shopify their button is rendering incorrectly

I have started to write a massive series of tech books. Basically, a from-almost-nothing-to-web-dev-with-Rails type series with everything a modern Rails dev is asked to know (Ruby, html, scss, sql, nosql, yaml, js, front-end frameworks etc etc).

I've started writing stuff down for it but one thing I wanted to do was get a realistic picture of what strong Rails projects asked of their new employees.

Shopify is a famous Rails team I thought. [They are even mentioned on the Rails website alongside Basecamp](http://rubyonrails.org/) so a good bet for some of the hard skills required but also the softer stuff a strong Rails team requires.

This [Software Dev position](http://www.shopify.com/careers/software-developer-2d1dee) was typical of what I looked at. 

Not tons of the tech used or required but a worthy shot. More culture than tech required. Likely a good sign for working there, but no luck in nailing down tech requirements.

As I scrolled down however, TO MY HORROR!, a button that disappeared part behind the footer.

> This seems to happen on every Shopify job positing I have been on as I scrolled right to the bottom of a job post. Was using Chrome. Not sure about other browsers.

Since early 2014 I've made a point to emailing/flagging up small issues to larger ones to companies. Doubly so if I pay for a product. I'm not a customer of Shopify but, they'd be more than happy to get a minor error flagged up?

## Let me email you

I took a screenshot and the URL and looked for a way to email the team. Found a "email us" button in their footer, pressed that so that I could email the team.

Took me to a contact us page.

Not exactly "email" us but the section on the left says something about email them. Another button down!

Drum roll...

Oh. Not at an email yet. Some commonly asked questions. Mostly about Shopify customer issues. Will to life intact but waning at this point.

Sidebar has yet another email us button. I'll press that. Third time the charm?

FINALLY A FORM! Before I got too excited, this form wasn't for ***me***. Everything listed was for customers and nothing about emailing them a small error I found.

Maybe I should have just gamed the form and sent the stuff anyway. But I didn't. I gave up there. Went to twitter. A lot of companies that is the best bet. Should have tried it faster I thought to myself. I'll get the email that way! Being a bit of an arse, this is what I tweeted:

In hindsight I should have just said 

"your button in the hiring bit of your site breaks a bit when I scroll to the bottom of the page. Here is said image"

but I was kinda locked into email mode. I like emails. I prefer to do that, that's me. I wanted to email how I found the error, what steps I went to just to tell them about it with URLs and images. Bit over the top but building and chatting about products all day means I try to give as much info to a team as possible even for a tiny fix.

Can't say the tweet back spoke that they were listening but I probs came across as some rambling product loon.

Hit them back with a plea for an email. Not heard back on that regard. Think I'm not getting one.

So, there it is. That is how you ***don't*** tell Shopify their button is broken.

A story worthy of telling your grandchildren is there ever was.
